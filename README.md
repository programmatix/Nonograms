# Nonograms
An implementation of the game Nonograms, in Scala.

The engine is completely immutable, and all components are nicely separated with no strong binding between UI and game logic.

## Status
Cannot play yet.

The solver AI is coming along but nowhere near complete.
Need this to create solvable levels for playing.

Scala.JS widget to display the AI's progress. 

## Usage
Should build fine.  Then open in Chrome:
