# Nonograms
An implementation of the puzzle game Nonograms, in Scala.

The engine is completely immutable, and all components are nicely separated with no strong binding between UI and game logic.

## Status
Playable.

The solver AI is coming along and can create solvable 10x10 puzzles usually in 20 iterations or less, but it could be a whole lot smarter. 

## Usage
Should build fine.  Then open in Chrome:
